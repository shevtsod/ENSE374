## Compilation

The folders in the root folder are Eclipse project. To compile in Eclipse, go to:

>File -> Open Projects from File System

Under `Import Source`, press `Directory` and navigate to the folder (lab1, lab2, etc.)
Click `Finish` to import the files as a project.
From there, find the folder to import and build.
