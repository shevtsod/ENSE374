# ENSE374
My solutions to labs in ENSE 374 - Software Project Management.

##Overview
> **Lab 1** - Introduction to Java  
> **Lab 2** - Introduction to Java in an IDE (Eclipse)  
> **Lab 3** - Introduction to revision control (Git)  

##Compilation
These compilation instructions apply to **Eclipse IDE for Java Neon.1**
To compile in Eclipse, go to
>File -> Open Projects from File System

Under `Import Source`, press `Directory` and navigate to the folder (lab1, lab2, etc.)
Click `Finish` to import the files as a project.
From there, find the folder to import and build.

##Details
###Lab 1 - Introduction to Java
Using a text editor, a class `SavingsAccount` was created to hold a bank savings account with monthly compounding interest. It was tested using a class `Bank` and saved as Phase 1. In Phase 2, another implementation of `SavingsAccount` with bi-weekly compounding interest was tested using the same Bank class.

###Lab 2 - Introduction to Java in an IDE (Eclipse)
Using any Java IDE (Eclipse), a class `Employee` was created to hold information for an employee to be tested in a class `Interface`. Instances of `Employee` were placed in an array and populated with data from a file containing randomly generated entries `RandomData.csv` (generated using [generatedata.com](http://www.generatedata.com/))

###Lab 3 - Introduction to revision control (Git) 
Introduction to revision control using command-line `Git`, the Windows shell interface [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/), and `GitHub`. Classes `ListElement` and `LinkedList` were created in Phase 1 to implement a single linked list to become familiar with revision control on `GitHub`. In Phase 2, a branch `doubleLinkedList` was created to modify the linked list and implement a double linked list.
